Here is the simple diode circuit and the I-V characteristic curve of a diode. The circuit shows a diode connected in series with a resistor and a DC voltage source. The I-V characteristic curve displays the exponential rise of current when the diode is forward-biased and almost no current in reverse bias until the breakdown region.

This diagram helps visualize how a diode operates in different biasing conditions. The forward bias leads to an exponential increase in current after a threshold voltage (typically 0.7V for silicon diodes), and in reverse bias, the diode blocks current flow, except when breakdown occurs at a high reverse voltage.
